# Personal-Website
My personal website, intended to use sebastianbaetz.com. It's been a great learning experience and it is still a work in progress.

# Why did I make this?

I have a few interesting projects I would love to show off to friends and potential employers, and I felt this was the best medium
for showing off my skills and learning new ones, like web development. I've spent more hours than I would like to admit on creating 
this website, especially when it comes to fixing certain simple errors, but that's part of the learning process. I still had a lot
of fun writing this, and I often make fixes to polish it even more.
