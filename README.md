# Personal-Website
My personal website, intended to use sebastianbaetz.com. It's been a great learning experience and it is still a work in progress.

#Why did I make this?

I have a few interesting projects I would love to show off to friends and potential employers, and I felt this was the best medium
for showing off my skills and learning new ones, like web development.
