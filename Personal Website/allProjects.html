            <h2>LIME: Layered Image Manipulation and Enhancement</h2>

            <h3>May 2021 - June 2021</h3>

            <p>
              LIME is the second project from my Object-Oriented Design class
              (CS 3500). It uses a Java Swing GUI to display certain image
              manipulation features to the user. Some features are sharpen/blur,
              greyscale/sepia, multi-layer image import/export, and PNG/JPEG
              support. <br /><br />

              This project was a great learning experience for me because I
              learned how to add to and test a large codebase (much larger than
              I have previously worked with) that I co-wrote. Additionally, this
              project stressed the importance of good design choices, as
              information would be omitted about what we need to do until it
              would certainly break bad designs. Throughout this assignment, I
              believe our design choices were well thought out.

            <h2>Freecell Solitare</h2>

            <h3>May 2021 - June 2021</h3>

            <p>
              This text-based freecell solitaire game was my first
              Object-Oriented Design (CS 3500) project. We were assigned parts
              of this project over three waves, each following wave would
              determine if we made the correct design choices. Along the way I
              made tweaks to my initial design to fit SOLID principles. The
              biggest challenge of this project for me was keeping the game
              rules to fit the standard freecell game, while simultaneously
              allowing for the possiblility of some new solitaire game to be
              added in the future, open to extension but closed for
              modification. <br /><br />

              This project also introduced me to JUnit testing, which I used
              very heavily in my test-driven development from this point on. I
              found it to be a necessity to ensure my code worked as intended,
              and always wrote tests first, then started the program logic.

              enjoyed the process very much and constantly work to improve the
              site.

              This project was based off of the XKCD Comic
              <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">found here</a> for an assignment
              in my Cybersecurity class. This was my first academic project in
              Python, and especially so using the argParse library to accomodate
              command line behaviour. While this was a smaller project, I
              enjoyed it very much. We were given the liberty of choosing any
              language for this assignment, and I wanted to use it to reinforce
              the Python I learned in community college.

            <p>
              This was the final project for my Fundamentals of CS II class.
              Initially, this project used Kruskal's Algorithm to generate
              minimum spanning trees which are perfect for maze generation. This
              was expanded with a new requirement: implement depth-first and
              breadth-first searching on this maze. My partner and I bolstered
              our previous design for extra credit by creating hexagonal mazes
              as a feature by pressing 'h'. Regular square mazes are default.

            <p>
              Floodit is a game where you start off in the top left corner, and
              must turn the entire board that color in the limited number of
              moves. The example we were given can be
              <a href="https://www.unixpapa.com/floodit/">found here</a>.
              Similar to Mastermind (next), this was also a challenge working
              with the image library to manipulate the colors the way we needed.
              Ultimately, we were successful using it, and managed to get extra
              credit as well.

              Mastermind is a single-player game where you must solve the hidden
              code, using nothing more to help than the hints received
              pertaining to direct matches and indirect matches. This project
              was a big challenge for my partner and I because of the image
              library that we needed to work with, but it served as a great
              lesson into using third-party Java libraries.
