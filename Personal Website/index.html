          <p>
            <br /><br />
            Howdy! My name is Sebastian Baetz and I am entering my second year
            at Northeastern University. I am originally from the San Antonio,
            Texas area where I earned my Associate of Science in Computer
            Science at Northwest Vista College.
            <br /><br />
            I am interested in back-end development primarily, I enjoy working
            with databases and creating the logic needed to work harmoniously
            with the front-end while creating extensible software.
            <br /><br />
            My favorite languages to work in are Java and Python, and I have
            been learning SQL and HTML/CSS while pursuing projects which you can
            find out more about
            <a href="index.html#projects">here</a>. One of my favorite classes
            from my Associate's program had a unit on Assembly which I throughly
            enjoyed as well. <br /><br />
            Outside of tech, I am an avid golfer, cyclist, amateur chef, and
            avid bookworm who loves to teach and help others in their pursuit of
            fun.
            <br /><br />
            I am currently looking for co-op and internship positions for the
            2022 Spring co-op cycle (Janurary 2022 through June 2022). If you
            would like to learn more about me, here is
            <a href="index.html">my resume</a>, and if you would like to have a
            chat, feel free to
            <a href="index.html#contactme">contact me here</a>.

            <h2>LIME: Layered Image Manipulation and Enhancement</h2>

            <h3>May 2021 - June 2021</h3>

            <p>
              LIME is the second project from my Object-Oriented Design class
              (CS 3500). It uses a Java Swing GUI to display certain image
              manipulation features to the user. Some features are sharpen/blur,
              greyscale/sepia, multi-layer image import/export, and PNG/JPEG
              support. <br /><br />

              This project was a great learning experience for me because I
              learned how to add to and test a large codebase (much larger than
              I have previously worked with) that I co-wrote. Additionally, this
              project stressed the importance of good design choices, as
              information would be omitted about what we need to do until it
              would certainly break bad designs. Throughout this assignment, I
              believe our design choices were well thought out.

            <h2>Freecell Solitare</h2>

            <h3>May 2021 - June 2021</h3>

            <p>
              This text-based freecell solitaire game was my first
              Object-Oriented Design (CS 3500) project. We were assigned parts
              of this project over three waves, each following wave would
              determine if we made the correct design choices. Along the way I
              made tweaks to my initial design to fit SOLID principles. The
              biggest challenge of this project for me was keeping the game
              rules to fit the standard freecell game, while simultaneously
              allowing for the possiblility of some new solitaire game to be
              added in the future, open to extension but closed for
              modification. <br /><br />

              This project also introduced me to JUnit testing, which I used
              very heavily in my test-driven development from this point on. I
              found it to be a necessity to ensure my code worked as intended,
              and always wrote tests first, then started the program logic.
